<p>Freud was born to&nbsp;<a title="Galicia (Eastern Europe)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galicia_(Eastern_Europe)">Galician</a>&nbsp;Jewish parents in the&nbsp;<a title="Moravia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravia">Moravian</a>&nbsp;town of&nbsp;<a title="Př&iacute;bor" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C5%99%C3%ADbor">Freiberg</a>, in the&nbsp;<a title="Austrian Empire" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Empire">Austrian Empire</a>. He qualified as a doctor of medicine in 1881 at the&nbsp;<a title="University of Vienna" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Vienna">University of Vienna</a>.&nbsp;Upon completing his&nbsp;<a title="Habilitation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habilitation">habilitation</a>&nbsp;in 1885, he was appointed a&nbsp;<a title="Docent" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docent">docent</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a title="Neuropathology" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropathology">neuropathology</a>&nbsp;and became an affiliated professor in 1902.&nbsp;Freud lived and worked in&nbsp;<a title="Vienna" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna">Vienna</a>, having set up his clinical practice there in 1886. In 1938, Freud left Austria to escape&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Nazi" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi">Nazi</a>&nbsp;persecution. He died in exile in the&nbsp;<a title="United Kingdom" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>&nbsp;in 1939.</p>
<p>In founding&nbsp;<a title="Psychoanalysis" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis">psychoanalysis</a>, Freud developed therapeutic techniques such as the use of&nbsp;<a title="Free association (psychology)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_association_(psychology)">free association</a>&nbsp;and discovered&nbsp;<a title="Transference" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transference">transference</a>, establishing its central role in the analytic process. Freud's redefinition of sexuality to include its infantile forms led him to formulate the&nbsp;<a title="Oedipus complex" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_complex">Oedipus complex</a>&nbsp;as the central tenet of psychoanalytical theory.&nbsp;His analysis of&nbsp;<a title="Dream" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream">dreams</a>&nbsp;as wish-fulfillments provided him with models for the clinical analysis of symptom formation and the underlying mechanisms of&nbsp;<a title="Repression (psychology)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repression_(psychology)">repression</a>. On this basis Freud elaborated his theory of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud#The_Unconscious">unconscious</a>&nbsp;and went on to develop a model of psychic structure comprising&nbsp;<a title="Id, ego and super-ego" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id,_ego_and_super-ego">id, ego and super-ego</a>.&nbsp;Freud postulated the existence of&nbsp;<a title="Libido" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libido">libido</a>, a sexualised energy with which mental processes and structures are invested and which generates erotic attachments, and a&nbsp;<a title="Death drive" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_drive">death drive</a>, the source of compulsive repetition, hate, aggression and&nbsp;<a title="Neurosis" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosis">neurotic</a>&nbsp;guilt.&nbsp;In his later works, Freud developed a wide-ranging interpretation and critique of religion and culture.</p>
<p>Though in overall decline as a diagnostic and clinical practice, psychoanalysis remains influential within&nbsp;<a title="Psychology" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology">psychology</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Psychiatry" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry">psychiatry</a>, and&nbsp;<a title="Psychotherapy" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy">psychotherapy</a>, and across the&nbsp;<a title="Humanities" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanities">humanities</a>. It thus continues to generate extensive and highly contested debate with regard to its therapeutic efficacy, its scientific status, and whether it advances or is detrimental to the&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Feminist" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist">feminist</a>&nbsp;cause.&nbsp;Nonetheless, Freud's work has suffused contemporary&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Western thought" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_thought">Western thought</a>&nbsp;and popular culture.&nbsp;<span class="nowrap"><a title="W. H. Auden" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._H._Auden">W. H. Auden</a>'s</span>&nbsp;1940 poetic tribute to Freud describes him as having created "a whole climate of opinion / under whom we conduct our different lives."</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung">Carl Jung</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Carl Gustav Jung</strong>&nbsp;(<span class="rt-commentedText nowrap"><span class="IPA nopopups noexcerpt"><a title="Help:IPA/English" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English">/<span title="/j/: 'y' in 'yes'">j</span><span title="/ʊ/: 'u' in 'push'">ʊ</span><span title="/ŋ/: 'ng' in 'sing'">ŋ</span>/</a></span></span>&nbsp;<a title="Help:Pronunciation respelling key" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key"><em title="English pronunciation respelling">YUUNG</em></a>,&nbsp;<small>German:&nbsp;</small><span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"><a title="Help:IPA/Standard German" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Standard_German">[kaʁl ˈjʊŋ]</a></span>; 26 July 1875&nbsp;&ndash; 6 June 1961) was a Swiss&nbsp;<a title="Psychiatrist" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatrist">psychiatrist</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Psychoanalyst" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalyst">psychoanalyst</a>&nbsp;who founded&nbsp;<a title="Analytical psychology" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_psychology">analytical psychology</a>. Jung's work was influential in the fields of&nbsp;<a title="Psychiatry" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry">psychiatry</a>, anthropology, archaeology, literature, philosophy, and religious studies. Jung worked as a research scientist at the famous&nbsp;<a title="Burgh&ouml;lzli" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgh%C3%B6lzli">Burgh&ouml;lzli</a>&nbsp;hospital, under&nbsp;<a title="Eugen Bleuler" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugen_Bleuler">Eugen Bleuler</a>. During this time, he came to the attention of&nbsp;<a title="Sigmund Freud" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud">Sigmund Freud</a>, the founder of&nbsp;<a title="Psychoanalysis" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis">psychoanalysis</a>. The two men conducted a&nbsp;<a title="The Freud/Jung Letters" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Freud/Jung_Letters">lengthy correspondence</a>&nbsp;and collaborated, for a while, on a joint vision of human psychology.</p>
<p>Freud saw the younger Jung as the heir he had been seeking to take forward his "new science" of psychoanalysis and to this end secured his appointment as President of his newly founded&nbsp;<a title="International Psychoanalytical Association" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Psychoanalytical_Association">International Psychoanalytical Association</a>. Jung's research and personal vision, however, made it impossible for him to follow his older colleague's doctrine, and a schism became inevitable. This division was personally painful for Jung and resulted in the establishment of Jung's analytical psychology as a comprehensive system separate from psychoanalysis.</p>
<p>Among the central concepts of analytical psychology is&nbsp;<a title="Individuation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individuation#Carl_Jung">individuation</a>&mdash;the lifelong psychological process of differentiation of the self out of each individual's conscious and unconscious elements. Jung considered it to be the main task of human development. He created some of the best known psychological concepts, including&nbsp;<a title="Synchronicity" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronicity">synchronicity</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Jungian archetypes" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_archetypes">archetypal phenomena</a>, the&nbsp;<a title="Collective unconscious" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_unconscious">collective unconscious</a>, the&nbsp;<a title="Complex (psychology)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_(psychology)">psychological complex</a>, and&nbsp;<a title="Extraversion and introversion" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion">extraversion and introversion</a>.</p>
<p>Jung was also an artist, craftsman and builder as well as a prolific writer. Many of his works were not published until after his death and some are still awaiting publication.</p>
