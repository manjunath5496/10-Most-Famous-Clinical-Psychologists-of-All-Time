<p>Freud was born to&nbsp;<a title="Galicia (Eastern Europe)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galicia_(Eastern_Europe)">Galician</a>&nbsp;Jewish parents in the&nbsp;<a title="Moravia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravia">Moravian</a>&nbsp;town of&nbsp;<a title="Př&iacute;bor" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C5%99%C3%ADbor">Freiberg</a>, in the&nbsp;<a title="Austrian Empire" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Empire">Austrian Empire</a>. He qualified as a doctor of medicine in 1881 at the&nbsp;<a title="University of Vienna" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Vienna">University of Vienna</a>.&nbsp;Upon completing his&nbsp;<a title="Habilitation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habilitation">habilitation</a>&nbsp;in 1885, he was appointed a&nbsp;<a title="Docent" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docent">docent</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a title="Neuropathology" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropathology">neuropathology</a>&nbsp;and became an affiliated professor in 1902.&nbsp;Freud lived and worked in&nbsp;<a title="Vienna" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna">Vienna</a>, having set up his clinical practice there in 1886. In 1938, Freud left Austria to escape&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Nazi" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi">Nazi</a>&nbsp;persecution. He died in exile in the&nbsp;<a title="United Kingdom" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>&nbsp;in 1939.</p>
<p>In founding&nbsp;<a title="Psychoanalysis" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis">psychoanalysis</a>, Freud developed therapeutic techniques such as the use of&nbsp;<a title="Free association (psychology)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_association_(psychology)">free association</a>&nbsp;and discovered&nbsp;<a title="Transference" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transference">transference</a>, establishing its central role in the analytic process. Freud's redefinition of sexuality to include its infantile forms led him to formulate the&nbsp;<a title="Oedipus complex" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_complex">Oedipus complex</a>&nbsp;as the central tenet of psychoanalytical theory.&nbsp;His analysis of&nbsp;<a title="Dream" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream">dreams</a>&nbsp;as wish-fulfillments provided him with models for the clinical analysis of symptom formation and the underlying mechanisms of&nbsp;<a title="Repression (psychology)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repression_(psychology)">repression</a>. On this basis Freud elaborated his theory of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud#The_Unconscious">unconscious</a>&nbsp;and went on to develop a model of psychic structure comprising&nbsp;<a title="Id, ego and super-ego" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id,_ego_and_super-ego">id, ego and super-ego</a>.&nbsp;Freud postulated the existence of&nbsp;<a title="Libido" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libido">libido</a>, a sexualised energy with which mental processes and structures are invested and which generates erotic attachments, and a&nbsp;<a title="Death drive" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_drive">death drive</a>, the source of compulsive repetition, hate, aggression and&nbsp;<a title="Neurosis" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosis">neurotic</a>&nbsp;guilt.&nbsp;In his later works, Freud developed a wide-ranging interpretation and critique of religion and culture.</p>
<p>Though in overall decline as a diagnostic and clinical practice, psychoanalysis remains influential within&nbsp;<a title="Psychology" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology">psychology</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Psychiatry" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry">psychiatry</a>, and&nbsp;<a title="Psychotherapy" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy">psychotherapy</a>, and across the&nbsp;<a title="Humanities" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanities">humanities</a>. It thus continues to generate extensive and highly contested debate with regard to its therapeutic efficacy, its scientific status, and whether it advances or is detrimental to the&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Feminist" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist">feminist</a>&nbsp;cause.&nbsp;Nonetheless, Freud's work has suffused contemporary&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Western thought" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_thought">Western thought</a>&nbsp;and popular culture.&nbsp;<span class="nowrap"><a title="W. H. Auden" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._H._Auden">W. H.
